## What is this Site for?

I've been interested in all things tech for a long time. I enjoy using **Linux** and experimenting with new **distributions** periodically, as well as **coding** and writing small **blog entries** when I feel inspired.

I began by writing small **Java** and **Go** programs and am currently learning **C/C++**, which, as you probably know, is quite a journey.

Consider this site a **hobby project** where errors might pop up; it's more of a test than anything else. Here, I aim to publish short **articles** on these topics. Feel free to browse!
